# MeX

MeX (Mobile Expense Claim) is an android application that will allow employees to enter the expense details in terms of date, description, and amount and attach a picture of bill either from the library/gallery or by capturing a photo from the camera. Upon submitting the claim, the entire data along with attached photos is uploaded to the server and queued for approval automatically by the relevant authority (here manager). Employee can also view the status of all pending claims. Upon approval, a confirmation email with the bill details is sent to the employee.
